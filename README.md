# Explorer--
A complete file Explorer written in batch, especially designed for batch programmers.
This offers extra tools for coders to do things like set custom launcers, search for
other versions of a file, and more! Explorer-- also supports plugins so developers can
add their own awesome creations to the tool!

**This program is still in development but is stable enough for it's first public release: Version 1.9!**
